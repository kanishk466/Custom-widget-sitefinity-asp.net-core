## Introduction

Sitefinity CMS allows developers to create and manage image libraries, providing a robust solution for handling images in web applications. This guide aims to assist developers in understanding how to leverage the image library functionality within Sitefinity CMS to enhance their projects.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- Sitefinity CMS installed and configured.
- Access to the Sitefinity CMS administrative interface with appropriate permissions.
- Basic understanding of ASP.NET MVC and Telerik Sitefinity.

## Getting Started

To start using image libraries in Sitefinity CMS, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure Sitefinity CMS.
2. Access the Sitefinity CMS administrative interface.
3. Navigate to the "Libraries" section.
4. Create a new image library.
5. Begin uploading and managing images within the library.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [official Sitefinity CMS documentation](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/for-developers-create-image-libraries).

## Creating Image Libraries

The process of creating image libraries involves:

- Defining metadata fields for images.
- Creating the image library itself.
- Configuring permissions for accessing and managing the library.
- Optionally, setting up workflows and permissions for content approval.

For code examples and detailed steps, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/for-developers-create-image-libraries).

## Managing Images

Once image libraries are created, developers can:

- Upload images.
- Organize images into folders.
- Apply metadata to images for better organization and searchability.
- Implement custom logic for image manipulation and processing.

For best practices and code samples, see the [official documentation](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/for-developers-create-image-libraries).

## Customizing Image Libraries

Developers can customize image libraries in Sitefinity CMS by:

- Implementing custom image uploaders.
- Extending metadata fields.
- Integrating third-party image processing libraries.
- Creating custom widgets for displaying images.

For advanced customization options and examples, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/for-developers-create-image-libraries).
